This repo is for review of requests for signing shim.  To create a request for review:

- clone this repo
- edit the template below
- add the shim.efi to be signed
- add build logs
- commit all of that
- tag it with a tag of the form "myorg-shim-arch-YYYYMMDD"
- push that to github
- file an issue at https://github.com/rhboot/shim-review/issues with a link to your branch

Note that we really only have experience with using grub2 on Linux, so asking
us to endorse anything else for signing is going to require some convincing on
your part.

Here's the template:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What organization or people are asking to have this signed:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unicon Software Entwicklungs- und Vertriebsgesellschaft mbH

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What product or service is this for:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
eLuxÂ® is a hardware-independent operating system for cloud computing environments

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What's the justification that this really does need to be signed for the whole world to be able to boot it:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We plan to support secure boot with our next release of eLux RP6 having a signed shim
will allow us to be hardware independant.

What upstream shim tag is this starting from:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HEAD of shim/15.2 branch (74b05de7d19fa4f462b6e228a8a03f8ee242b673)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
URL for a repo that contains the exact code which was built to get this binary:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
https://github.com/rhboot/shim/tree/74b05de7d19fa4f462b6e228a8a03f8ee242b673

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What patches are being applied and why:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No additional patches are applied

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What OS and toolchain must we use to reproduce this build?  Include where to find it, etc.  We're going to try to reproduce your build as close as possible to verify that it's really a build of the source tree you tell us it is, so these need to be fairly thorough. At the very least include the specific versions of gcc, binutils, and gnu-efi which were used, and where to find those binaries.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The toolchain is based on Ubuntu 16.04 with gnu-efi 3.0.9-1 backported from Ubuntu 20.04

- gcc: 5.4.0 20160609 (Ubuntu 5.4.0-6ubuntu1~16.04.9unicon1)
- binutils: 2.26.1-1ubuntu1~16.04.3
- gnu-efi: 3.0.9-1

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Which files in this repo are the logs for your build?   This should include logs for creating the buildroots, applying patches, doing the build, creating the archives, etc.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Build command: make EFI_PATH=/usr/lib VENDOR_CERT_FILE=UniconCodeSign-valid20230910.pem EFIDIR=eLux &> build.log
Log filename: build.log

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Add any additional information you think we may need to validate this shim
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
None
